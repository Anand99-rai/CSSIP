**PROJECT 1 :**
QR Code Scanner is a lightweight and efficient tool for scanning and decoding QR codes. This project provides a simple yet powerful interface for users to scan QR codes using their device's camera or by uploading an image containing a QR code. The application can recognize and decode various types of QR codes, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

Features :
Real-Time Scanning: Scan QR codes instantly using your device's camera.
Image Upload Support: Decode QR codes from images stored on your device.
Multi-Format Support: Recognizes different types of QR codes, including URLs, text, and contact information.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use design for seamless scanning experience.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on both web and mobile platforms.

**PROJECT 2 :**
Real-Time Stock Scraping This project provides a Python-based solution for real-time stock price scraping from finance websites. Using web scraping techniques, this tool fetches the latest stock prices directly from Yahoo Finance and displays them in the terminal. The project is designed to be a simple yet effective way to monitor stock prices in real-time.

Features Real-Time Data Fetching: Scrapes up-to-date stock prices from finance websites. Flexible Implementation: Utilizes BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content and extracting stock information.

**PROJECT 3 :**
GUI-Based Calculator

Project Overview:
The GUI-Based Calculator is a desktop application developed to perform basic arithmetic operations or specialized financial calculations, such as investments or SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) calculations. This project leverages a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with users, making it user-friendly and visually accessible. The calculator is built using the Python programming language and utilizes the Tkinter library for the GUI components.

Objectives:
User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface where users can input numbers and operators through buttons rather than the keyboard.
Real-Time Calculation: Allow users to see the result of their arithmetic expressions immediately upon pressing the equals button or the Enter key.
Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to ensure that invalid inputs or operations do not crash the application.
Flexibility: Provide the option to build either a simple calculator for basic arithmetic or a specialized calculator for tasks such as investment or SIP calculations.

Key Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Developed using Python's Tkinter library.
Buttons for digits (0-9), basic operators (+, -, *, /), and additional functions (clear, evaluate).
An entry widget where users can view and edit their expressions.

Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are supported.
Real-time evaluation of expressions.
The output is displayed directly in the entry widget.

Customizable:

The calculator can be easily adapted to include more complex operations.
Special-purpose calculators, like an investment calculator, can be built by modifying the evaluation function to incorporate financial formulas.

Error Handling:

The application manages invalid inputs gracefully by displaying an "Error" message in the entry widget.
Technical Details:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: Tkinter (for GUI development)
Environment: Runs on any system with Python installed
User Input: Inputs are provided via on-screen buttons, and the expression is displayed in an entry field.
